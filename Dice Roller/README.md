# **Dice Roller**
This is a simple python program designed to simulate the roll of a single six-sided die and provide the result to the user. The program accepts input from the user in the form of 1 or 0, where 1 starts the dice rolling and 0 ends the program.

To use the program, run it from the command line and enter 1 to start the dice rolling. After the dice is rolled, the program will display the result. You can continue to roll the dice by entering 1, or end the program by entering 0.


Here is an example of how to use the program:

    Welcome to the simple dice roller program.

    Enter 1 to start rolling the dice or 0 to end: 1

    The dice landed on: 3

    Enter 1 to roll again or 0 to end: 1

    The dice landed on: 5

    Enter 1 to roll again or 0 to end: 0

    Thanks for playing!
